<h2 align="center" >Hello, IamToqst<h2>
  
  Hi IamToqst, i know Python, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP programming languages.

  I know Python very well and i use it most of the times.

  JavaScript, yeah i know it and i kinda hate it because i dont know much of it since its kinda hard for me to learn it.

  HTML, bruh i dont even know it this thing is a real programming language.

  PHP, I like php when making PocketMine MP plugins its very simple but if your gonna tell me to do something with it's API in it i cant do it because i suck at it, instead of fixing or making things better i make it even more worse.
